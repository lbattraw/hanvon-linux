Hanvon tablet driver
====================

Driver for Linux kernels which supports complete functionality of the tablet:
pen coordinates, touch/float/click detection, pressure, x and y tilt, pen
button. On Artmaster I four simple tablet buttons (note that the first
one works only together with pen activity), and the slider button.

If everything goes right the tablet should start working immediately.
